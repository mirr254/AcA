The vice is a global concern that denies Intellectual Property Rights owners their deserved benefits. This practice has been a thorny issue to entrepreneurs and consumers in Kenya for a long time. \n \n The Anti-Counterfeit Act \n\n The parliament of Kenya enacted the Anti-Counterfeit Act No.13 of 2008.  This Act of parliament was enacted to prohibit trade in counterfeit goods. Organizations and regulatory bodies came together in the spirit of the Act to consolidate efforts and promote inter-agency corporations to fight this thriving trade, through the formation of the Anti-counterfeit Agency (ACA)."
